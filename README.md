🏦 Bank Management System (C++)

A console-based Bank Management System built using C++. It demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, file handling, and persistent data storage by simulating real-world banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, and transaction history management.

🚀 Features
Create new customer accounts with unique account numbers.
Deposit and withdraw money with balance validation.
Check account balance and display account details.
Search accounts by customer name (case-insensitive).
View all customer accounts in tabular format.
Maintain and display complete transaction history.
Persistent storage using text files (bank_data.txt, transactions_data.txt).
Interactive console menu with input validation.
